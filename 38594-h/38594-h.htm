<p>The supreme problem of every age is that of finding its consummate
artistic expression. Before this problem every other remains of
secondary importance. History defines and directs its physical course,
science cooperates in the achievement of its material aims, but Art
alone gives to the age its spiritual physiognomy, its ultimate and
lasting expression.</p>

<p>The process of Art is on the one hand sensuous, the conception having
for its basis the fineness of organization of the senses; and on the
other hand it is severely scientific, the value of the creation being
dependent upon the craftsmanship, the mastery over the tool, the
technique.</p>

<p>Art, like Nature, its great and only reservoir for all time past and all
time to come, ever strives for elimination and selection. It is severe
and aristocratic in the application of its laws and impervious to appeal
to serve other than its own aims. Its purpose is the symbolization of
Life. In its sanctum there reigns the silence of vast accomplishment,
the serene, final, and imperturbable solitude which is the ultimate
criterion of all great things created.</p>

<p>To speak of Poetry is to speak of the most subtle, the most delicate,
and the most accurate instrument by which to measure Life.</p>

<p>Poetry is reality's essence visioned and made manifest by one endowed
with a perception acutely sensitive to sound, form, and colour, and
gifted with a power to shape into rhythmic and rhymed verbal symbols the
reaction to Life's phenomena. The poet moulds that which appears
evanescent and ephemeral in image and in mood into everlasting values.
In this act of creation he serves eternity.</p>

<p>Poetry, in especial lyrical poetry, must be acknowledged the supreme
art, culminating as it does in a union of the other arts, the musical,
the plastic, and the pictorial.</p>

<p>The most eminent contemporary poets of Europe have, each in accordance
with his individual temperament, reflected in their work the spiritual
essence of our age, its fears and failures, its hopes and high
achievements: Maeterlinck, with his mood of resignation and his
retirement into a dusky twilight where his shadowy figures move
noiselessly like phantoms in fate-laden dimness; Dehmel, the worshipper
of will, with his passion for materiality and the beauty of all things
physical and tangible; Verhaeren, the visionary of a new vitality, who
sees in the toilers of fields and factories the heroic gesture of our
time and who might have written its great epic of industry but for the
overwhelming lyrical mood of his soul.</p>

<p>Until a few years ago, known only to a relatively small community on the
continent but commanding an ever increasing attention which has borne
his name far beyond the boundary of his country, the personality of
Rainer Maria Rilke stands to-day beside the most illustrious poets of
modern Europe.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>The background against which the figure of Rainer Maria Rilke is
silhouetted is so varied, the influences which have entered into his
life are so manifold, that a study of his work, however slight, must
needs take into consideration the elements through which this poet has
matured into a great master.</p>

<p>Prague, the city in which Rilke was born in 1875, with its sinister
palaces and crumbling towers that rose in the early Middle Ages and have
reached out into our time like the threatening fingers of mighty hands
which have wielded swords for generations and which are stained with the
blood of many wounds of many races; the city where amid grey old ruins
blonde maidens are at play or are lost in reverie in the green cool
parks and shady gardens with which the Bohemian capital abounds, this
Prague of mingled grotesqueness and beauty gave to the young boy his
first impressions.</p>

<p>There is a period in the life of every artist when his whole being seems
lost in a contemplation of the surrounding world, when the application
to work is difficult, like the violent forcing of something that is
awaiting its time. This is the time of his dream, as sacred as the days
of early spring before wind and rain and light have touched the fruits
of the fields, when there is a tense bleak silence over the whole of
nature, in which is wrapped the strength of storms and the glow of the
summer's sun. This is the time of his deepest dream, and upon this dream
and its guarding depends the final realization of his life's work.</p>

<p>The young graduate of the Gymnasium was to enter upon the career of an
army officer in accordance with the traditions of the family, an old
noble house which traces its lineage far back to Carinthian ancestry.
His inclinations, however, pointed so decisively in the direction of the
finer arts of life that he left the Military Academy after a very short
attendance to devote himself to the study of philosophy and the history
of art.</p>

<p>As one turns the pages of Rilke's first small book of poems, published
originally under the title <i>Larenopfer</i>, in the year 1895, and which
appeared in more recent editions under the less descriptive name <i>Erste
Gedichte</i>, one realizes at once, in spite of a lack of plasticity in the
presentation, that here speaks one who has lingered long and lovingly
over the dream of his boyhood. As the title indicates, these poems are a
tribute, an offering to the Lares, the home spirits of his native town.
Prague and the surrounding country are the ever recurring theme of
almost every one of these poems. The meadows, the maidens, the dark
river in the evening, the spires of the cathedral at night rising like
grey mists are seen with a wonderment, the great well-spring of all
poetic imagination, with a well-nigh religious piety. Through all these
poems there sounds like a subdued accompaniment a note of gratitude for
the ability to thus vision the world, to be sunk in the music of all
things. "Without is everything that I feel within myself, and without
and within myself everything is immeasurable, illimitable."</p>

<p>These pictures of town and landscape are never separated from their
personal relation to the poet. He feels too keenly his dependence upon
them, as a child views flowers and stars as personal possessions. Not
until later was he to reach the height of an impersonal objectivity in
his art. What distinguishes these early poems from similar adolescent
productions is the restraint in the presentation, the economy and
intensity of expression and that quality of listening to the inner voice
of things which renders the poet the seer of mankind.</p>

<p>The second book of poems appeared two years later and like the first
volume <i>Traumgekrönt</i> is full of the music that is reminiscent of the
mild melancholy of the Bohemian folk-songs, in whose gentle rhythms the
barbaric strength of the race seems to be lulled to rest as the waves of
a far-away tumultuous sea gently lap the shore. The themes of
<i>Traumgekrönt</i> are extended somewhat beyond the immediate environment
of Prague and some of the most beautiful poems are luminous pictures of
villages hidden in the snowy blossoming of May and June, out of which
rises here and there the solitary soft voice of a boy or girl singing.
In these first two volumes the poet is satisfied with painting in words,
full of sonorous beauty, the surrounding world. From this period dates
the small poem <i>Evening</i>, which seems to have been sketched by a
Japanese painter, so clear and colourful is its texture, so precious and
precise are its outlines.</p>

<p>With <i>Advent</i> and <i>Mir Zur Feier</i>, both published within the following
three years, a phase of questioning commences, a dim desire begins to
stir to reach out into the larger world "deep into life, out beyond
time." Whereas the early poems were characterized by a tendency to turn
away from the turmoil of life&mdash;in fact, the concrete world of reality
does not seem to exist&mdash;there is noticeable in these two later volumes
an advance toward life in the sense that the poet is beginning to
approach and to vision some of its greatest symbols.</p>

<p>Throughout the entire work of Rilke, in his poetry as well as in his
interpretations of painting and sculpture, there are two elements that
constitute the cornerstones in the structure of his art. If, as has been
said with a degree of verity, Nietzsche was primarily a musician whose
philosophy had for its basis and took its ultimate aspects from the
musical quality of his artistic endowment, it may be maintained with an
equal amount of truth that Rilke is primarily a painter and sculptor
whose poetry rests upon the fundaments of the pictorial and plastic
arts.</p>

<p>Up to the time of the publication of these volumes, Rilke's poems
possessed a quietude, a stillness suggested in the straight unbroken yet
delicate lines of the picture which he portrays and in the soft, almost
unpulsating rhythm of his words. The approach of evening or nightfall,
the coming of dawn, the change of the seasons, the slow changes of light
into darkness and of darkness into light, in short, the most silent yet
greatest metamorphoses in the external aspects of nature form the
contents of many of these first poems. The inanimate object and the
living creature in nature are not seen in the sharp contours of their
isolation; they are viewed and interpreted in the atmosphere that
surrounds them, in which they are enwrapped and so densely veiled that
the outlines are only dimly visible, be that atmosphere the mystic grey
of northern twilight or the dark velvety blue of southern summer nights.
In <i>Advent</i>, the experience of the atmosphere becomes an experience in
his innermost soul and, therefore, all things become of value to him
only in so far as they partake of the atmosphere, as they are seen in a
peculiar air and distance. This first phase in Rilke's work may be
defined as the phase of reposeful nature.</p>

<p>To this sphere of relaxation and restfulness in which the objects are
static and are changed only as the surrounding atmosphere affects them,
the second phase in the poet's development adds another element, which
later was to grow into dimensions so powerful, so violently breaking
beyond the limitations of simple expression in words that it could only
find its satisfaction in a dithyrambic hymn to the work of the great
plastic artist of our time, to the creations of Auguste Rodin. This
second element is that which the French sculptor in a different medium
has carried to perfection. It is the element of gesture, of dramatic
movement.</p>

<p>This might seem the appropriate place in which to speak of Rilke's
monograph on the art of Rodin. To do so would, however, be an undue
anticipation, for it will be necessary to trace Rilke's development
through several transitions before the value of his contact with the
work of Rodin can be fully measured.</p>

<p>The gesture, the movement begins in <i>Advent</i> and <i>Celebration</i> to
disturb the stillness prevailing in the first two volumes of poems. Even
here it is only gentle and shy at first like the stirring of a breath of
wind over a quiet sea; and gentle beings make this first gesture,
children and young women at play, singing, dancing or at prayer.</p>

<p>Particularly in the cycle <i>Songs of the Maidens</i> in the book
<i>Celebration</i>, the atmosphere is condensed and becomes the psychic
background of the landscape against which the gesture of longing or
expectation is seen and felt. It is the impatience to burst into
blossoming, the longing for love which pulsates in these <i>Songs of the
Maidens</i> with the tenseness of suspense. <i>The Prayers of the Maidens to
Mary</i> have not the mild melody of maidenly prayer; they vibrate with the
ecstasy of expectant life, and the Madonna is more than the Heavenly
Virgin, their longing transforms her into the symbol of earthly love and
motherhood. This expectation, in spite of its intensity, is subdued and
is only heard like the cadence of a far off dream:</p>

<p>
"How shall I go on tiptoe<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">From childhood to Annunciation</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Through the dim twilight</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Into Thy Garden?"</span><br />
</p>

<p>Mention should be made of some prose writings which Rilke published in
the year 1898 and shortly afterward. They are <i>Two Stories of Prague</i>,
<i>The Touch of Life</i> and <i>The Last</i>; three volumes of short stories; a
two-act drama, <i>The Daily Life</i>, points to a strong Maeterlinck
influence, and finally <i>Stories of God</i>. With both beauty of detail and
problematic interest, the short stories show an incoherence of treatment
and a lack of dramatic co-ordination easily conceivable in a poet who is
essentially lyrical and who at that time had not mastered the means of
technique to give to his characters the clear chiselling of the epic
form.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>A sojourn in Russia and especially the acquaintance with the novels of
Dostoievsky became potent factors in Rilke's development and served to
deepen creations which without this influence might have terminated in a
grandiose æsthesia.</p>

<p>Broadly speaking, Russian art and literature may be described as
springing from an ethical impulse and as having for their motive power
and <i>raison d'être</i> the tendency toward socio-political reform, in
contradistinction to the art and literature of Western culture, whose
motives and aims are primarily of an æsthetic nature and seek in art the
reconciliation of the dualism between spirit and matter.</p>

<p>Dostoievsky, whom Merejkovsky describes somewhere as the man with the
never-young face, the face "with its shadows of suffering and its
wrinkles of sunken-in cheeks ... but that which gives to this face its
most tortured expression is its seeming immobility, the suddenly
interrupted impulse, the life hardened into a stone:" this Dostoievsky
and particularly his <i>Rodion Raskolnikov</i> cycle became a profound
artistic experience to Rilke. The poor, the outcasts, the homeless ones
received for him a new significance, the significance of the isolated
figure placed in the mighty everchanging current of a life in which this
figure stands strong and solitary. In the poem entitled <i>Pont Du
Carrousel</i>, written in Paris a few years later, Rilke has visioned the
blind beggar aloof amid the fluctuating crowds of the metropolis.</p>

<p>Of Russia and its influence upon him, Rilke writes: "Russia became for
me the reality and the deep daily realization that reality is something
that comes infinitely slowly to those who have patience. Russia is the
country where men are solitary, each one with a world within himself,
each one profound in his humbleness and without fear of humiliating
himself, and because of that truly pious. Here the words of men are only
fragile bridges above their real life."</p>

<p>The great symbols of Solitude and of Death enter into the poet's work.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>In the first decade of the new century Rilke reached the height of his
art and with a few exceptions the poems represented in this volume are
selected from the poems which were published between the years 1900 and
1908. The ascent toward the acme of Rilke's art after the year 1900 is
as rapid as it is precipitous. Only a few years previous we read in
Advent:</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"That is longing: To dwell in the flux of things,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">To have no home in the present.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">And these are wishes: gentle dialogues</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Of the poor hours with eternity."</span><br />
</p>

<p>With <i>Das Buch der Bilder</i> the dream is ended, the veil of mist is
lifted and before us are revealed pictures and images that rise before
our eyes in clear colourful contours. Whether the poet conjures from the
depths of myth <i>The Kings in Legends</i>, or whether we read from <i>The
Chronicle of a Monk</i> the awe-inspiring description of <i>The Last Judgment
Day</i>, or whether in Paris on a Palm Sunday we see <i>The Maidens at
Confirmation</i>, the pictures presented stand out with the clearness and
finality of the typical.</p>

<p>It is a significant fact that Rilke dedicated this book to Gerhart
Hauptmann, "in love and gratitude for his Michael Kramer." Hauptmann,
like Rilke in these poems, has placed before us great epic figures and
his art is so concentrated that often the simple expression of the
thought of one of his characters produces a shudder in the listener or
reader because in this thought there vibrates the suffering of an entire
social class and in it resounds the sorrow of many generations.</p>

<p>In <i>The Book of Pictures</i>, Rilke's art reaches its culmination on what
might be termed its monumental side. The visualization is elevated to
the impersonal objective level which gives to the rhythm of these poems
an imperturbable calm, to the figures presented a monumental erectness.
<i>The Men of the House of Colonna</i>, <i>The Czars</i>, <i>Charles XII Riding
Through the Ukraine</i> are portrayed each with his individual historical
gesture, with a luminosity as strong as the colour and movement which
they gave to their time. In the mythical poem, <i>Kings in Legends</i>, this
concrete element in the art of Rilke has found perhaps its supreme
expression:</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"Kings in old legends seem</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Like mountains rising in the evening light.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">They blind all with their gleam,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Their loins encircled are by girdles bright,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Their robes are edged with bands</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Of precious stones&mdash;the rarest earth affords&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">With richly jeweled hands</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">They hold their slender, shining, naked swords."</span><br />
</p>

<p>There are in <i>The Book of Pictures</i> poems in which this will to
concentrate a mood into its essence and finality is applied to purely
lyrical poems as in <i>Initiation</i>, that stands out in this volume like
"the great dark tree" itself so immeasurable is the straight line of its
aspiration reaching into the far distant silence of the night; or as in
the poem entitled <i>Autumn</i>, with its melancholy mood of gentle descent
in all nature.</p>

<p>In <i>The Book of Hours</i>, Rilke withdraws from the world not from
weariness but weighed down under the manifold conflicting visions. As
the prophet who would bring to the world a great possession must go
forth into the desert to be alone until the kingdom comes to him from
within, so the poet must leave the world in order to gain the deeper
understanding, to be face to face with God. The mood of <i>Das
Stunden-Buch</i> is this mood of being face to face with God; it elevates
these poems to prayer, profound prayer of doubt and despair, exalted
prayer of reconciliation and triumph.</p>

<p><i>The Book of Hours</i> contains three parts written at different periods in
the poet's life: <i>The Book of a Monk's Life</i> (1899); <i>The Book of
Pilgrimage</i> (1901), and <i>The Book of Poverty and Death</i> (1903), although
the entire volume was not published until several years later. <i>The Book
of Hours</i> glows with a mystic fervour to know God, to be near him. In
this desire to approach the Nameless One, the young Brother in <i>The Book
of a Monk's Life</i> builds up about God parables, images and legends
reminiscent of those of the 17th century Angelus Silesius, but sustained
by a more pregnant language because exalted by a more ardent visionary
force. The motif of <i>The Monk's Life</i> is expressed in the poem beginning
with the lines:</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"I live my life in circles that grow wide</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">And endlessly unroll."</span><br />
</p>

<p>Through the grey cell of the young Monk there flash in luminous
magnificence the colours of the great renaissance masters, for he feels
in Titian, in Michelangelo, in Raphael the same fervour that animates
him; they, too, are worshippers of the same God.</p>

<p>There are poems in <i>The Book of Pilgrimage</i> of the stillness of a
whispered prayer in a great Cathedral and there are others that carry in
their exultation the music of mighty hymns. The visions in this second
book are no less ecstatic though less glowingly colourful; they have
withdrawn inward and have brought a great peace and a great faith as in
the poem of God, whose very manifestation is the quietude and hush of a
silent world:</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"By day Thou art the Legend and the Dream</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">That like a whisper floats about all men,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">The deep and brooding stillnesses which seem,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">After the hour has struck, to close again.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">And when the day with drowsy gesture bends</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">And sinks to sleep beneath the evening skies,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">As from each roof a tower of smoke ascends</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">So does Thy Realm, my God, around me rise."</span><br />
</p>

<p>The last part of <i>The Book of Hours</i>, <i>The Book of Poverty and Death</i>,
is finally a symphony of variations on the two great symbolic themes in
the work of Rilke. As Christ in the parable of the rich young man
demands the abandonment of all treasures, so in this book the poet sees
the coming of the Kingdom, the fulfilment of all our longings for a
nearness to God when we have become simple again like little children
and poor in possessions like God Himself. In this phase of Rilke's
development, the principle of renunciation constitutes a certain
negative element in his philosophy. The poet later proceeded to a
positive acquiescence toward man's possessions, at least those acquired
or created in the domain of art.</p>

<p>In our approach through the mystic we touch reality most deeply. It is
because of this that all art and all philosophy culminate in their final
forms in a crystallization of those values of life that remain forever
inexplicable to pure reason; they become religious in the simple,
profound sense of that word. Before the eternal facts of Life doubt and
strife are reconciled into faith, will and pride change into humility.
The realization of this truth expressed in the medium of poetry is the
significance of Rilke's <i>Book of Hours</i>. A distinguished Scandinavian
writer has pronounced <i>Das Stunden-Buch</i> one of the supreme literary
achievements of our time and its deepest and most beautiful book of
prayer.</p>

<p>In his subsequent poetic work Rilke did not again reach the sustained
high quality of this book, the mood and idea of which he incorporated
into a prose work of exquisite lyrical beauty: <i>The Sketch of Malte
Laurids Brigge</i>.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>In <i>New Poems</i> (1907) and <i>New Poems, Second Part</i> (1908) the historical
figure, frequently taken from the Old Testament, has grown beyond the
proportions of life; it is weightier with fate and invariably becomes
the means of expressing symbolically an abstract thought or a great
human destiny. <i>Abishag</i> presents the contrast between the dawning and
the fading life; <i>David Singing Before Saul</i> shows the impatience of
awakening ambition, and <i>Joshua</i> is the man who forces even God to do
his will. The antique Hellenic world rises with shining splendour in the
poems <i>Eranna to Sappho</i>, <i>Lament for Antinous</i>, <i>Early Apollo</i> and the
<i>Archaic Torso of Apollo</i>.</p>

<p>The spirit of the Middle Ages with its religious fervour and
superstitious fanaticism is symbolized in several poems, the most
important among which are <i>The Cathedral</i>, <i>God in the Middle Ages</i>,
<i>Saint Sebastian</i> personifying martyrdom, and <i>The Rose Window</i>, whose
glowing magic is compared to the hypnotic power of the tiger's eye.
Modern Paris is often the background of the <i>New Poems</i>, and the crass
play of light and shadow upon the waxen masks of Life's disillusioned in
the Morgue is caught with the same intense realistic vision as the
flamingos and parrots spreading their vari-coloured soft plumage in the
warmth of the sun in the Avenue of the Jardin des Plantes.</p>

<p>Almost all of the poems in these two volumes are short and precise. The
images are portrayed with the sensitive intensity of impressionistic
technique. The majestic quietude of the long lines of <i>The Book of
Pictures</i> is broken, the colours are more vibrant, more scintillating
and the pictures are painted in nervous, darting strokes as though to
convey the manner in which they were perceived: in one single,
all-absorbing glance. For this reason many of these <i>New Poems</i> are not
quite free from a certain element of virtuosity. On the other hand,
Rilke achieves at times a perfect surety of rapid stroke as in the poem
<i>The Spanish Dancer</i>, who rises luminously on the horizon of our inner
vision like a circling element of fire, flaming and blinding in the
momentum of her movements. Degas and Zuloaga seem to have combined their
art on one canvas to give to this dancer the abundant elasticity of
grace and the splendid fantasy of colour.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Many of the themes in the <i>New Poems</i> bear testimony to the fact that
Rilke travelled extensively, prior to the writing of these volumes, in
Italy, Germany, France, and Scandinavia. His book on the five painters
at the artists' colony at Worpswede, where he remained for a time,
entirely given over to the observation of the atmosphere, the movement
of the sky and the play of light upon the far heath of this northern
landscape, is an introduction to every interpretation of the work of
landscape painters and a tender poem to a land whose solitary and
melancholy beauty entered into his own work.</p>

<p>More vital than the influence of the personalities and the art treasures
of the countries which Rilke visited and more potent in its effect upon
his creations, like a great sun over the most fruitful years of his
life, stands the towering personality of Auguste Rodin. The <i>New Poems</i>
bear the dedication: "A mon grand ami, Auguste Rodin," indicating the
twofold influence which the French sculptor wielded over the poet, that
of a friend and that of an artist.</p>

<p>One recalls the broad, solidly-built figure of Rodin with his rugged
features and high, finely chiselled forehead, moving slowly among the
white glistening marble busts and statues as a giant in an old legend
moves among the rocks and mountains of his realm, patient, all-enduring,
the man who has mastered life, strong and tempered by the storms of
time. And one thinks of Rainer Maria Rilke, young, blond, with his
slender aristocratic figure, the slightly bent-forward figure of one who
on solitary walks meditates much and intensely, with his sensitive full
mouth and the "firm structure of the eyebrow gladly sunk in the shadow
of contemplation," the face full of dreams and with an expression of
listening to some distant music.</p>

<p>From no other book of his, not excepting <i>The Book of Hours</i>, can we
deduce so accurate a conception of Rilke's philosophy of Life and Art as
we can draw from his comparatively short monograph on Auguste Rodin.</p>

<p>Rilke sees in Rodin the dominant personification in our age of the
"power of servitude in all nature." For this reason the book on Rodin is
far more than a purely æsthetic valuation of the sculptor's work; Rilke
traces throughout the book the strongly ethical principle which works
itself out in every creative act in the realm of art. This grasp of the
deeper significance of all art gives to the book on Rodin its well-nigh
religious aspect of thought and its hymnlike rhythm of expression. He
begins: "Rodin was solitary before fame came to him, and afterward he
became perhaps still more solitary. For fame is ultimately but the
summary of all misunderstandings that crystallize about a new name." And
he sums up this one man's greatness: "Sometime it will be realized what
has made this great artist so supreme. He was a worker whose only desire
was to penetrate with all his forces into the humble and the difficult
significance of his tool. Therein lay a certain renunciation of life but
in just this renunciation lay his triumph&mdash;for Life entered into his
work."</p>

<p>Rodin became to Rilke the manifestation of the divine principle of the
creative impulse in man. Thus Rilke's monograph on Auguste Rodin will
remain the poet's testament on Life and Art.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Rilke has lived deeply; he has absorbed into his artistic and spiritual
consciousness many of the supreme values of our time. His art holds the
mystic depth of the Slav, the musical strength of the German, and the
visual clarity of the Latin. As artist, he has felt life to be sacred,
and as a priest, he has brought to its altar many offerings.</p>

<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Past fathomless dark depths that he commands</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">A shallow generation drifting goes....</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 2em;">She thinks: I am&mdash;Have you not seen?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Who are you then, Marie?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">I am a Queen, I am a Queen!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">To your knee, to your knee!</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And then she weeps: I was&mdash;a child&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Who were you then, Marie?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Know you that I was no man's child,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Poor and in rags&mdash;said she.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And then a Princess I became</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">To whom men bend their knees;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">To princes things are not the same</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">As those a beggar sees.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And those things which have made you great</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Came to you, tell me, when?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">One night, one night, one night quite late,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Things became different then.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">I walked the lane which presently</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">With strung chords seemed to bend;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Then Marie became Melody</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And danced from end to end.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The people watched with startled mien</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And passed with frightened glance</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">For all know that only a Queen</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">May dance in the lanes: dance!...</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 2em;">A light is shining but the distant star</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">From which it still comes to me has been dead</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">A thousand years ... In the dim phantom boat</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">That glided past some ghastly thing was said.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">A clock just struck within some house remote.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Which house?&mdash;I long to still my beating heart.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Beneath the sky's vast dome I long to pray ...</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Of all the stars there must be far away</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">A single star which still exists apart.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And I believe that I should know the one</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Which has alone endured and which alone</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Like a white City that all space commands</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">At the ray's end in the high heaven stands.</span><br />

<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">As when at times there breaks through branches bare</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">A morning vibrant with the breath of spring,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">About this poet-head a splendour rare</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Transforms it almost to a mortal thing.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">There is as yet no shadow in his glance,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Too cool his temples for the laurel's glow;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">But later o'er those marble brows, perchance,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">A rose-garden with bushes tall will grow,</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And single petals one by one will fall</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">O'er the still mouth and break its silent thrall,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&mdash;The mouth that trembles with a dawning smile</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">As though a song were rising there the while.</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 2em;">We still remember! The same as of yore</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">All that has happened once again must be.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">As grows a lemon-tree upon the shore&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">It was like that&mdash;your light, small breasts you bore,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And his blood's current coursed like the wild sea.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">That god&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 7em;">who was the wanderer, the slim</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Despoiler of fair women; he&mdash;the wise,&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">But sweet and glowing as your thoughts of him</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Who cast a shadow over your young limb</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">While bending like your arched brows o'er your eyes.</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Your swift wings wound me as they whir along;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Without you void would be my day and night,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Without you I'll not capture my great song.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">I have no earthly spot where I can live,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">I have no love, I have no household fane,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And all the things to which myself I give</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Impoverish me with richness they attain.</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 2em;">His weary glance, from passing by the bars,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Has grown into a dazed and vacant stare;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">It seems to him there are a thousand bars</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And out beyond those bars the empty air.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The pad of his strong feet, that ceaseless sound</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Of supple tread behind the iron bands,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Is like a dance of strength circling around,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">While in the circle, stunned, a great will stands.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">But there are times the pupils of his eyes</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Dilate, the strong limbs stand alert, apart,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Tense with the flood of visions that arise</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Only to sink and die within his heart.</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Who sipped her tea as if one apart,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And she held her cup not quite like the rest;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Once she smiled so it pierced one's heart.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">When the group of people arose at last</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And laughed and talked in a merry tone,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">As lingeringly through the rooms they passed</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">I saw that she followed alone.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Tense and still like one who to sing must rise</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Before a throng on a festal night</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">She lifted her head, and her bright glad eyes</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Were like pools which reflected light.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">She followed on slowly after the last</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">As though some object must be passed by,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And yet as if were it once but passed</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">She would no longer walk but fly.</span><br />

<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">As a lit match first flickers in the hands</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Before it flames, and darts out from all sides</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Bright, twitching tongues, so, ringed by growing bands</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Of spectators&mdash;she, quivering, glowing stands</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Poised tensely for the dance&mdash;then forward glides</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And suddenly becomes a flaming torch.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Her bright hair flames, her burning glances scorch,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And with a daring art at her command</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Her whole robe blazes like a fire-brand</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">From which is stretched each naked arm, awake,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Gleaming and rattling like a frightened snake.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And then, as though the fire fainter grows,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">She gathers up the flame&mdash;again it glows,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">As with proud gesture and imperious air</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">She flings it to the earth; and it lies there</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Furiously flickering and crackling still&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Then haughtily victorious, but with sweet</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Swift smile of greeting, she puts forth her will</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And stamps the flames out with her small firm feet.</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 2em;">When from the past I draw myself the while</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The round breast would not blind you with its grace,</span><br />

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">I live my life in circles that grow wide</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And endlessly unroll,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">I may not reach the last, but on I glide</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Strong pinioned toward my goal.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">About the old tower, dark against the sky,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The beat of my wings hums,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">I circle about God, sweep far and high</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">On through milleniums.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Am I a bird that skims the clouds along,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Or am I a wild storm, or a great song?</span><br />
</p>


<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Many have painted her. But there was one</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Who drew his radiant colours from the sun.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Mysteriously glowing through a background dim</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">When he was suffering she came to him,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And all the heavy pain within his heart</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Rose in his hands and stole into his art.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">His canvas is the beautiful bright veil</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Through which her sorrow shines. There where the</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Texture o'er her sad lips is closely drawn</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">A trembling smile softly begins to dawn ...</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Though angels with seven candles light the place</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">You cannot read the secret of her face.</span><br />
</p>


<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">In cassocks clad I have had many brothers</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">In southern cloisters where the laurel grows,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">They paint Madonnas like fair human mothers</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And I dream of young Titians and of others</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">In which the God with shining radiance glows.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">But though my vigil constantly I keep</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">My God is dark&mdash;like woven texture flowing,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">A hundred drinking roots, all intertwined;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">I only know that from His warmth I'm growing.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">More I know not: my roots lie hidden deep</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">My branches only are swayed by the wind.</span><br />
</p>


<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Thou Anxious One! And dost thou then not hear</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Against thee all my surging senses sing?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">About thy face in circles drawing near</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">My thought floats like a fluttering white wing.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Dost thou not see, before thee stands my soul</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">In silence wrapt my Springtime's prayer to pray?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">But when thy glance rests on me then my whole</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Being quickens and blooms like trees in May.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">When thou art dreaming then I am thy Dream,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">But when thou art awake I am thy Will</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Potent with splendour, radiant and sublime,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Expanding like far space star-lit and still</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Into the distant mystic realm of Time.</span><br />
</p>


<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">I love my life's dark hours</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">In which my senses quicken and grow deep,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">While, as from faint incense of faded flowers</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Or letters old, I magically steep</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Myself in days gone by: again I give</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Myself unto the past:&mdash;again I live.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Out of my dark hours wisdom dawns apace,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Infinite Life unrolls its boundless space ...</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Then I am shaken as a sweeping storm</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Shakes a ripe tree that grows above a grave</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">'Round whose cold clay the roots twine fast and warm&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And Youth's fair visions that glowed bright and brave,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Dreams that were closely cherished and for long,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Are lost once more in sadness and in song.</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Perform no miracles for me,</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Who still sat at table and drank from the glass</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And ever within the walls did abide&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">For out of the house he could no more pass.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And his children set forth to seek for the spot</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Where stands the great Church which he forgot.</span><br />
</p>


<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Extinguish my eyes, I still can see you,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Close my ears, I can hear your footsteps fall,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And without feet I still can follow you,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And without voice I still can to you call.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Break off my arms, and I can embrace you,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Enfold you with my heart as with a hand.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Hold my heart, my brain will take fire of you</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">As flax ignites from a lit fire-brand&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And flame will sweep in a swift rushing flood</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Through all the singing currents of my blood.</span><br />
</p>


<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">In the deep nights I dig for you, O Treasure!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">To seek you over the wide world I roam,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">For all abundance is but meager measure</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Of your bright beauty which is yet to come.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Over the road to you the leaves are blowing,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Few follow it, the way is long and steep.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">You dwell in solitude&mdash;Oh, does your glowing</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Heart in some far off valley lie asleep?</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">My bloody hands, with digging bruised, I've lifted,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Spread like a tree I stretch them in the air</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">To find you before day to night has drifted;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">I reach out into space to seek you there ...</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Then, as though with a swift impatient gesture,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Flashing from distant stars on sweeping wing,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">You come, and over earth a magic vesture</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Steals gently as the rain falls in the spring.</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 2em;">That cannot utter sound, nor breathe, nor kiss,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">But that had once from Life received all this</span><br />

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See

individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with

keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
