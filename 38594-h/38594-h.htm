</p>

<p>The supreme problem of every age is that of finding its consummate
artistic expression. Before this problem every other remains of
secondary importance. History defines and directs its physical course,
science cooperates in the achievement of its material aims, but Art
alone gives to the age its spiritual physiognomy, its ultimate and
lasting expression.</p>

<p>The process of Art is on the one hand sensuous, the conception having
for its basis the fineness of organization of the senses; and on the
other hand it is severely scientific, the value of the creation being
dependent upon the craftsmanship, the mastery over the tool, the
technique.</p>

<p>Art, like Nature, its great and only reservoir for all time past and all
time to come, ever strives for elimination and selection. It is severe
and aristocratic in the application of its laws and impervious to appeal
to serve other than its own aims. Its purpose is the symbolization of
Life. In its sanctum there reigns the silence of vast accomplishment,
the serene, final, and imperturbable solitude which is the ultimate
criterion of all great things created.</p>

<p>To speak of Poetry is to speak of the most subtle, the most delicate,
and the most accurate instrument by which to measure Life.</p>

<p>Poetry is reality's essence visioned and made manifest by one endowed
with a perception acutely sensitive to sound, form, and colour, and
gifted with a power to shape into rhythmic and rhymed verbal symbols the
reaction to Life's phenomena. The poet moulds that which appears
evanescent and ephemeral in image and in mood into everlasting values.
In this act of creation he serves eternity.</p>

<p>Poetry, in especial lyrical poetry, must be acknowledged the supreme
art, culminating as it does in a union of the other arts, the musical,
the plastic, and the pictorial.</p>

<p>The most eminent contemporary poets of Europe have, each in accordance
with his individual temperament, reflected in their work the spiritual
essence of our age, its fears and failures, its hopes and high
achievements: Maeterlinck, with his mood of resignation and his
retirement into a dusky twilight where his shadowy figures move
noiselessly like phantoms in fate-laden dimness; Dehmel, the worshipper
of will, with his passion for materiality and the beauty of all things
physical and tangible; Verhaeren, the visionary of a new vitality, who
sees in the toilers of fields and factories the heroic gesture of our
time and who might have written its great epic of industry but for the
overwhelming lyrical mood of his soul.</p>

<p>Until a few years ago, known only to a relatively small community on the
continent but commanding an ever increasing attention which has borne
his name far beyond the boundary of his country, the personality of
Rainer Maria Rilke stands to-day beside the most illustrious poets of
modern Europe.</p>

<hr />

<p>The background against which the figure of Rainer Maria Rilke is
silhouetted is so varied, the influences which have entered into his
life are so manifold, that a study of his work, however slight, must
needs take into consideration the elements through which this poet has
matured into a great master.</p>

<p>Prague, the city in which Rilke was born in 1875, with its sinister
palaces and crumbling towers that rose in the early Middle Ages and have
reached out into our time like the threatening fingers of mighty hands
which have wielded swords for generations and which are stained with the
blood of many wounds of many races; the city where amid grey old ruins
blonde maidens are at play or are lost in reverie in the green cool
parks and shady gardens with which the Bohemian capital abounds, this
Prague of mingled grotesqueness and beauty gave to the young boy his
first impressions.</p>

<p>There is a period in the life of every artist when his whole being seems
lost in a contemplation of the surrounding world, when the application
to work is difficult, like the violent forcing of something that is
awaiting its time. This is the time of his dream, as sacred as the days
of early spring before wind and rain and light have touched the fruits
of the fields, when there is a tense bleak silence over the whole of
nature, in which is wrapped the strength of storms and the glow of the
summer's sun. This is the time of his deepest dream, and upon this dream
and its guarding depends the final realization of his life's work.</p>

<p>The young graduate of the Gymnasium was to enter upon the career of an
army officer in accordance with the traditions of the family, an old
noble house which traces its lineage far back to Carinthian ancestry.
His inclinations, however, pointed so decisively in the direction of the
finer arts of life that he left the Military Academy after a very short
attendance to devote himself to the study of philosophy and the history
of art.</p>

<p>As one turns the pages of Rilke's first small book of poems, published
originally under the title <i>Larenopfer</i>, in the year 1895, and which
appeared in more recent editions under the less descriptive name <i>Erste
Gedichte</i>, one realizes at once, in spite of a lack of plasticity in the
presentation, that here speaks one who has lingered long and lovingly
over the dream of his boyhood. As the title indicates, these poems are a
tribute, an offering to the Lares, the home spirits of his native town.
Prague and the surrounding country are the ever recurring theme of
almost every one of these poems. The meadows, the maidens, the dark
river in the evening, the spires of the cathedral at night rising like
grey mists are seen with a wonderment, the great well-spring of all
poetic imagination, with a well-nigh religious piety. Through all these
poems there sounds like a subdued accompaniment a note of gratitude for
the ability to thus vision the world, to be sunk in the music of all
things. "Without is everything that I feel within myself, and without
and within myself everything is immeasurable, illimitable."</p>

<p>These pictures of town and landscape are never separated from their
personal relation to the poet. He feels too keenly his dependence upon
them, as a child views flowers and stars as personal possessions. Not
until later was he to reach the height of an impersonal objectivity in
his art. What distinguishes these early poems from similar adolescent
productions is the restraint in the presentation, the economy and
intensity of expression and that quality of listening to the inner voice
of things which renders the poet the seer of mankind.</p>

<p>The second book of poems appeared two years later and like the first
volume <i>Traumgekrönt</i> is full of the music that is reminiscent of the
mild melancholy of the Bohemian folk-songs, in whose gentle rhythms the
barbaric strength of the race seems to be lulled to rest as the waves of
a far-away tumultuous sea gently lap the shore. The themes of
<i>Traumgekrönt</i> are extended somewhat beyond the immediate environment
of Prague and some of the most beautiful poems are luminous pictures of
villages hidden in the snowy blossoming of May and June, out of which
rises here and there the solitary soft voice of a boy or girl singing.
In these first two volumes the poet is satisfied with painting in words,
full of sonorous beauty, the surrounding world. From this period dates
the small poem <i>Evening</i>, which seems to have been sketched by a
Japanese painter, so clear and colourful is its texture, so precious and
precise are its outlines.</p>

<p>With <i>Advent</i> and <i>Mir Zur Feier</i>, both published within the following
three years, a phase of questioning commences, a dim desire begins to
stir to reach out into the larger world "deep into life, out beyond
time." Whereas the early poems were characterized by a tendency to turn
away from the turmoil of life&mdash;in fact, the concrete world of reality
does not seem to exist&mdash;there is noticeable in these two later volumes
an advance toward life in the sense that the poet is beginning to
approach and to vision some of its greatest symbols.</p>

<p>Throughout the entire work of Rilke, in his poetry as well as in his
interpretations of painting and sculpture, there are two elements that
constitute the cornerstones in the structure of his art. If, as has been
said with a degree of verity, Nietzsche was primarily a musician whose
philosophy had for its basis and took its ultimate aspects from the
musical quality of his artistic endowment, it may be maintained with an
equal amount of truth that Rilke is primarily a painter and sculptor
whose poetry rests upon the fundaments of the pictorial and plastic
arts.</p>

<p>Up to the time of the publication of these volumes, Rilke's poems
possessed a quietude, a stillness suggested in the straight unbroken yet
delicate lines of the picture which he portrays and in the soft, almost
unpulsating rhythm of his words. The approach of evening or nightfall,
the coming of dawn, the change of the seasons, the slow changes of light
into darkness and of darkness into light, in short, the most silent yet
greatest metamorphoses in the external aspects of nature form the
contents of many of these first poems. The inanimate object and the
living creature in nature are not seen in the sharp contours of their
isolation; they are viewed and interpreted in the atmosphere that
surrounds them, in which they are enwrapped and so densely veiled that
the outlines are only dimly visible, be that atmosphere the mystic grey
of northern twilight or the dark velvety blue of southern summer nights.
In <i>Advent</i>, the experience of the atmosphere becomes an experience in
his innermost soul and, therefore, all things become of value to him
only in so far as they partake of the atmosphere, as they are seen in a
peculiar air and distance. This first phase in Rilke's work may be
defined as the phase of reposeful nature.</p>

<p>To this sphere of relaxation and restfulness in which the objects are
static and are changed only as the surrounding atmosphere affects them,
the second phase in the poet's development adds another element, which
later was to grow into dimensions so powerful, so violently breaking
beyond the limitations of simple expression in words that it could only
find its satisfaction in a dithyrambic hymn to the work of the great
plastic artist of our time, to the creations of Auguste Rodin. This
second element is that which the French sculptor in a different medium
has carried to perfection. It is the element of gesture, of dramatic
movement.</p>

<p>This might seem the appropriate place in which to speak of Rilke's
monograph on the art of Rodin. To do so would, however, be an undue
anticipation, for it will be necessary to trace Rilke's development
through several transitions before the value of his contact with the
work of Rodin can be fully measured.</p>

<p>The gesture, the movement begins in <i>Advent</i> and <i>Celebration</i> to
disturb the stillness prevailing in the first two volumes of poems. Even
here it is only gentle and shy at first like the stirring of a breath of
wind over a quiet sea; and gentle beings make this first gesture,
children and young women at play, singing, dancing or at prayer.</p>

<p>Particularly in the cycle <i>Songs of the Maidens</i> in the book
<i>Celebration</i>, the atmosphere is condensed and becomes the psychic
background of the landscape against which the gesture of longing or
expectation is seen and felt. It is the impatience to burst into
blossoming, the longing for love which pulsates in these <i>Songs of the
Maidens</i> with the tenseness of suspense. <i>The Prayers of the Maidens to
Mary</i> have not the mild melody of maidenly prayer; they vibrate with the
ecstasy of expectant life, and the Madonna is more than the Heavenly
Virgin, their longing transforms her into the symbol of earthly love and
motherhood. This expectation, in spite of its intensity, is subdued and
is only heard like the cadence of a far off dream:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 20%;">
"How shall I go on tiptoe<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">From childhood to Annunciation</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Through the dim twilight</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Into Thy Garden?"</span><br />
</p>

<p>Mention should be made of some prose writings which Rilke published in
the year 1898 and shortly afterward. They are <i>Two Stories of Prague</i>,
<i>The Touch of Life</i> and <i>The Last</i>; three volumes of short stories; a
two-act drama, <i>The Daily Life</i>, points to a strong Maeterlinck
influence, and finally <i>Stories of God</i>. With both beauty of detail and
problematic interest, the short stories show an incoherence of treatment
and a lack of dramatic co-ordination easily conceivable in a poet who is
essentially lyrical and who at that time had not mastered the means of
technique to give to his characters the clear chiselling of the epic
form.</p>

<hr />

<p>A sojourn in Russia and especially the acquaintance with the novels of
Dostoievsky became potent factors in Rilke's development and served to
deepen creations which without this influence might have terminated in a
grandiose æsthesia.</p>

<p>Broadly speaking, Russian art and literature may be described as
springing from an ethical impulse and as having for their motive power
and <i>raison d'être</i> the tendency toward socio-political reform, in
contradistinction to the art and literature of Western culture, whose
motives and aims are primarily of an æsthetic nature and seek in art the
reconciliation of the dualism between spirit and matter.</p>

<p>Dostoievsky, whom Merejkovsky describes somewhere as the man with the
never-young face, the face "with its shadows of suffering and its
wrinkles of sunken-in cheeks ... but that which gives to this face its
most tortured expression is its seeming immobility, the suddenly
interrupted impulse, the life hardened into a stone:" this Dostoievsky
and particularly his <i>Rodion Raskolnikov</i> cycle became a profound
artistic experience to Rilke. The poor, the outcasts, the homeless ones
received for him a new significance, the significance of the isolated
figure placed in the mighty everchanging current of a life in which this
figure stands strong and solitary. In the poem entitled <i>Pont Du
Carrousel</i>, written in Paris a few years later, Rilke has visioned the
blind beggar aloof amid the fluctuating crowds of the metropolis.</p>

<p>Of Russia and its influence upon him, Rilke writes: "Russia became for
me the reality and the deep daily realization that reality is something
that comes infinitely slowly to those who have patience. Russia is the
country where men are solitary, each one with a world within himself,
each one profound in his humbleness and without fear of humiliating
himself, and because of that truly pious. Here the words of men are only
fragile bridges above their real life."</p>

<p>The great symbols of Solitude and of Death enter into the poet's work.</p>

<hr />

<p>In the first decade of the new century Rilke reached the height of his
art and with a few exceptions the poems represented in this volume are
selected from the poems which were published between the years 1900 and
1908. The ascent toward the acme of Rilke's art after the year 1900 is
as rapid as it is precipitous. Only a few years previous we read in
Advent:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 20%;">
"That is longing: To dwell in the flux of things,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">To have no home in the present.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And these are wishes: gentle dialogues</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Of the poor hours with eternity."</span><br />
</p>

<p>With <i>Das Buch der Bilder</i> the dream is ended, the veil of mist is
lifted and before us are revealed pictures and images that rise before
our eyes in clear colourful contours. Whether the poet conjures from the
depths of myth <i>The Kings in Legends</i>, or whether we read from <i>The
Chronicle of a Monk</i> the awe-inspiring description of <i>The Last Judgment
Day</i>, or whether in Paris on a Palm Sunday we see <i>The Maidens at
Confirmation</i>, the pictures presented stand out with the clearness and
finality of the typical.</p>

<p>It is a significant fact that Rilke dedicated this book to Gerhart
Hauptmann, "in love and gratitude for his Michael Kramer." Hauptmann,
like Rilke in these poems, has placed before us great epic figures and
his art is so concentrated that often the simple expression of the
thought of one of his characters produces a shudder in the listener or
reader because in this thought there vibrates the suffering of an entire
social class and in it resounds the sorrow of many generations.</p>

<hr />

<p>In <i>The Book of Pictures</i>, Rilke's art reaches its culmination on what
might be termed its monumental side. The visualization is elevated to
the impersonal objective level which gives to the rhythm of these poems
an imperturbable calm, to the figures presented a monumental erectness.
<i>The Men of the House of Colonna</i>, <i>The Czars</i>, <i>Charles XII Riding
Through the Ukraine</i> are portrayed each with his individual historical
gesture, with a luminosity as strong as the colour and movement which
they gave to their time. In the mythical poem, <i>Kings in Legends</i>, this
concrete element in the art of Rilke has found perhaps its supreme
expression:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 20%;">
"Kings in old legends seem<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Like mountains rising in the evening light.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">They blind all with their gleam,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Their loins encircled are by girdles bright,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Their robes are edged with bands</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Of precious stones&mdash;the rarest earth affords&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">With richly jeweled hands</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">They hold their slender, shining, naked swords."</span><br />
</p>

<p>There are in <i>The Book of Pictures</i> poems in which this will to
concentrate a mood into its essence and finality is applied to purely
lyrical poems as in <i>Initiation</i>, that stands out in this volume like
"the great dark tree" itself so immeasurable is the straight line of its
aspiration reaching into the far distant silence of the night; or as in
the poem entitled <i>Autumn</i>, with its melancholy mood of gentle descent
in all nature.</p>

<p>In <i>The Book of Hours</i>, Rilke withdraws from the world not from
weariness but weighed down under the manifold conflicting visions. As
the prophet who would bring to the world a great possession must go
forth into the desert to be alone until the kingdom comes to him from
within, so the poet must leave the world in order to gain the deeper
understanding, to be face to face with God. The mood of <i>Das
Stunden-Buch</i> is this mood of being face to face with God; it elevates
these poems to prayer, profound prayer of doubt and despair, exalted
prayer of reconciliation and triumph.</p>

<p><i>The Book of Hours</i> contains three parts written at different periods in
the poet's life: <i>The Book of a Monk's Life</i> (1899); <i>The Book of
Pilgrimage</i> (1901), and <i>The Book of Poverty and Death</i> (1903), although
the entire volume was not published until several years later. <i>The Book
of Hours</i> glows with a mystic fervour to know God, to be near him. In
this desire to approach the Nameless One, the young Brother in <i>The Book
of a Monk's Life</i> builds up about God parables, images and legends
reminiscent of those of the 17th century Angelus Silesius, but sustained
by a more pregnant language because exalted by a more ardent visionary
force. The motif of <i>The Monk's Life</i> is expressed in the poem beginning
with the lines:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 20%;">
"I live my life in circles that grow wide<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And endlessly unroll."</span><br />
</p>

<p>Through the grey cell of the young Monk there flash in luminous
magnificence the colours of the great renaissance masters, for he feels
in Titian, in Michelangelo, in Raphael the same fervour that animates
him; they, too, are worshippers of the same God.</p>

<p>There are poems in <i>The Book of Pilgrimage</i> of the stillness of a
whispered prayer in a great Cathedral and there are others that carry in
their exultation the music of mighty hymns. The visions in this second
book are no less ecstatic though less glowingly colourful; they have
withdrawn inward and have brought a great peace and a great faith as in
the poem of God, whose very manifestation is the quietude and hush of a
silent world:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 20%;">
"By day Thou art the Legend and the Dream<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">That like a whisper floats about all men,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">The deep and brooding stillnesses which seem,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">After the hour has struck, to close again.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And when the day with drowsy gesture bends</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And sinks to sleep beneath the evening skies,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">As from each roof a tower of smoke ascends</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">So does Thy Realm, my God, around me rise."</span><br />
</p>

<p>The last part of <i>The Book of Hours</i>, <i>The Book of Poverty and Death</i>,
is finally a symphony of variations on the two great symbolic themes in
the work of Rilke. As Christ in the parable of the rich young man
demands the abandonment of all treasures, so in this book the poet sees
the coming of the Kingdom, the fulfilment of all our longings for a
nearness to God when we have become simple again like little children
and poor in possessions like God Himself. In this phase of Rilke's
development, the principle of renunciation constitutes a certain
negative element in his philosophy. The poet later proceeded to a
positive acquiescence toward man's possessions, at least those acquired
or created in the domain of art.</p>

<p>In our approach through the mystic we touch reality most deeply. It is
because of this that all art and all philosophy culminate in their final
forms in a crystallization of those values of life that remain forever
inexplicable to pure reason; they become religious in the simple,
profound sense of that word. Before the eternal facts of Life doubt and
strife are reconciled into faith, will and pride change into humility.
The realization of this truth expressed in the medium of poetry is the
significance of Rilke's <i>Book of Hours</i>. A distinguished Scandinavian
writer has pronounced <i>Das Stunden-Buch</i> one of the supreme literary
achievements of our time and its deepest and most beautiful book of
prayer.</p>

<p>In his subsequent poetic work Rilke did not again reach the sustained
high quality of this book, the mood and idea of which he incorporated
into a prose work of exquisite lyrical beauty: <i>The Sketch of Malte
Laurids Brigge</i>.</p>

<hr />

<p>In <i>New Poems</i> (1907) and <i>New Poems, Second Part</i> (1908) the historical
figure, frequently taken from the Old Testament, has grown beyond the
proportions of life; it is weightier with fate and invariably becomes
the means of expressing symbolically an abstract thought or a great
human destiny. <i>Abishag</i> presents the contrast between the dawning and
the fading life; <i>David Singing Before Saul</i> shows the impatience of
awakening ambition, and <i>Joshua</i> is the man who forces even God to do
his will. The antique Hellenic world rises with shining splendour in the
poems <i>Eranna to Sappho</i>, <i>Lament for Antinous</i>, <i>Early Apollo</i> and the
<i>Archaic Torso of Apollo</i>.</p>

<p>The spirit of the Middle Ages with its religious fervour and
superstitious fanaticism is symbolized in several poems, the most
important among which are <i>The Cathedral</i>, <i>God in the Middle Ages</i>,
<i>Saint Sebastian</i> personifying martyrdom, and <i>The Rose Window</i>, whose
glowing magic is compared to the hypnotic power of the tiger's eye.
Modern Paris is often the background of the <i>New Poems</i>, and the crass
play of light and shadow upon the waxen masks of Life's disillusioned in
the Morgue is caught with the same intense realistic vision as the
flamingos and parrots spreading their vari-coloured soft plumage in the
warmth of the sun in the Avenue of the Jardin des Plantes.</p>

<p>Almost all of the poems in these two volumes are short and precise. The
images are portrayed with the sensitive intensity of impressionistic
technique. The majestic quietude of the long lines of <i>The Book of
Pictures</i> is broken, the colours are more vibrant, more scintillating
and the pictures are painted in nervous, darting strokes as though to
convey the manner in which they were perceived: in one single,
all-absorbing glance. For this reason many of these <i>New Poems</i> are not
quite free from a certain element of virtuosity. On the other hand,
Rilke achieves at times a perfect surety of rapid stroke as in the poem
<i>The Spanish Dancer</i>, who rises luminously on the horizon of our inner
vision like a circling element of fire, flaming and blinding in the
momentum of her movements. Degas and Zuloaga seem to have combined their
art on one canvas to give to this dancer the abundant elasticity of
grace and the splendid fantasy of colour.</p>

<hr  />

<p>Many of the themes in the <i>New Poems</i> bear testimony to the fact that
Rilke travelled extensively, prior to the writing of these volumes, in
Italy, Germany, France, and Scandinavia. His book on the five painters
at the artists' colony at Worpswede, where he remained for a time,
entirely given over to the observation of the atmosphere, the movement
of the sky and the play of light upon the far heath of this northern
landscape, is an introduction to every interpretation of the work of
landscape painters and a tender poem to a land whose solitary and
melancholy beauty entered into his own work.</p>

<p>More vital than the influence of the personalities and the art treasures
of the countries which Rilke visited and more potent in its effect upon
his creations, like a great sun over the most fruitful years of his
life, stands the towering personality of Auguste Rodin. The <i>New Poems</i>
bear the dedication: "A mon grand ami, Auguste Rodin," indicating the
twofold influence which the French sculptor wielded over the poet, that
of a friend and that of an artist.</p>

<p>One recalls the broad, solidly-built figure of Rodin with his rugged
features and high, finely chiselled forehead, moving slowly among the
white glistening marble busts and statues as a giant in an old legend
moves among the rocks and mountains of his realm, patient, all-enduring,
the man who has mastered life, strong and tempered by the storms of
time. And one thinks of Rainer Maria Rilke, young, blond, with his
slender aristocratic figure, the slightly bent-forward figure of one who
on solitary walks meditates much and intensely, with his sensitive full
mouth and the "firm structure of the eyebrow gladly sunk in the shadow
of contemplation," the face full of dreams and with an expression of
listening to some distant music.</p>

<p>From no other book of his, not excepting <i>The Book of Hours</i>, can we
deduce so accurate a conception of Rilke's philosophy of Life and Art as
we can draw from his comparatively short monograph on Auguste Rodin.</p>

<p>Rilke sees in Rodin the dominant personification in our age of the
"power of servitude in all nature." For this reason the book on Rodin is
far more than a purely æsthetic valuation of the sculptor's work; Rilke
traces throughout the book the strongly ethical principle which works
itself out in every creative act in the realm of art. This grasp of the
deeper significance of all art gives to the book on Rodin its well-nigh
religious aspect of thought and its hymnlike rhythm of expression. He
begins: "Rodin was solitary before fame came to him, and afterward he
became perhaps still more solitary. For fame is ultimately but the
summary of all misunderstandings that crystallize about a new name." And
he sums up this one man's greatness: "Sometime it will be realized what
has made this great artist so supreme. He was a worker whose only desire
was to penetrate with all his forces into the humble and the difficult
significance of his tool. Therein lay a certain renunciation of life but
in just this renunciation lay his triumph&mdash;for Life entered into his
work."</p>

<p>Rodin became to Rilke the manifestation of the divine principle of the
creative impulse in man. Thus Rilke's monograph on Auguste Rodin will
remain the poet's testament on Life and Art.</p>

<hr />

<p>Rilke has lived deeply; he has absorbed into his artistic and spiritual
consciousness many of the supreme values of our time. His art holds the
mystic depth of the Slav, the musical strength of the German, and the
visual clarity of the Latin. As artist, he has felt life to be sacred,
and as a priest, he has brought to its altar many offerings.</p>

And with a gesture that he held most dear<br />
Down for a moment by his side she knelt.<br />

Toward the piano they both shyly glanced<br />

Would listen strangely as if half entranced,<br />

Upon the hand which by her ring seemed bent<br />
And slowly wandering o'er the white keys went<br />
Moving as though against a drift of snow.<br />

Before us great Death stands<br />
Our fate held close within his quiet hands.<br />
When with proud joy we lift Life's red wine<br />
To drink deep of the mystic shining cup<br />
And ecstasy through all our being leaps&mdash;<br />
Death bows his head and weeps.<br />

No vision of exotic southern countries,<br />
No dancing women, supple, brown and tall<br />
Whirling from out their falling draperies<br />
To melodies that beat a fierce mad call;<br />
<br />
No sound of songs that from the hot blood rise,<br />
No langorous, stretching, dusky, velvet maids<br />
Flashing like gleaming weapon their bright eyes,<br />
No swift, wild thrill the quickening blood pervades.<br />
<br />
Only mouths widening with a still broad smile<br />
Of comprehension, a strange knowing leer<br />
At white men, at their vanity and guile,<br />
An understanding that fills one with fear.<br />
<br />
The beasts in cages much more loyal are,<br />
Restlessly pacing, pacing to and fro,<br />
Dreaming of countries beckoning from afar,<br />
Lands where they roamed in days of long ago.<br />
<br />
They burn with an unquenched and smothered fire<br />
Consumed by longings over which they brood,<br />
Oblivious of time, without desire,<br />
Alone and lost in their great solitude.<br />

Expectant and waiting you muse<br />
On the great rare thing which alone<br />
To enhance your life you would choose:<br />
The awakening of the stone,<br />
The deeps where yourself you would lose.<br />
<br />
In the dusk of the shelves, embossed<br />
Shine the volumes in gold and browns,<br />
And you think of countries once crossed,<br />
Of pictures, of shimmering gowns<br />
Of the women that you have lost.<br />
<br />
And it comes to you then at last&mdash;<br />
And you rise for you are aware<br />
Of a year in the far off past<br />
With its wonder and fear and prayer.<br />

What play you, O Boy? Through the garden it stole<br />
Like wandering steps, like a whisper&mdash;then mute;<br />
What play you, O Boy? Lo! your gypsying soul<br />
Is caught and held fast in the pipes of Pan's flute.<br />
<br />
And what conjure you? Imprisoned is the song,<br />
It lingers and longs in the reeds where it lies;<br />
Your young life is strong, but how much more strong<br />
Is the longing that through your music sighs.<br />
<br />
Let your flute be still and your soul float through<br />
Waves of sound formless as waves of the sea,<br />
For here your song lived and it wisely grew<br />
Before it was forced into melody.<br />
<br />
Its wings beat gently, its note no more calls,<br />
Its flight has been spent by you, dreaming Boy!<br />
Now it no longer steals over my walls&mdash;<br />
But in my garden I'd woo it to joy.<br />

A young knight comes into my mind<br />
As from some myth of old.<br />
<br />
He came! You felt yourself entwined<br />
As a great storm would round you wind.<br />
He went! A blessing undefined<br />
Seemed left, as when church-bells declined<br />
And left you wrapt in prayer.<br />
You fain would cry aloud&mdash;but bind<br />
Your scarf about you and tear-blind<br />
Weep softly in its fold.<br />
<br />
A young knight comes into my mind<br />
Full armored forth to fare.<br />
<br />
His smile was luminously kind<br />
Like glint of ivory enshrined,<br />
Like a home longing undivined,<br />
Like Christmas snows where dark ways wind,<br />
Like sea-pearls about turquoise twined,<br />
Like moonlight silver when combined<br />
With a loved book's rare gold.<br />

<br />
<br />
The white veiled maids to confirmation go<br />
Through deep green garden paths they slowly wind;<br />
Their childhood they are leaving now behind:<br />
The future will be different, they know.<br />
<br />
Oh! Will it come? They wait&mdash;It must come soon!<br />
The next long hour slowly strikes at last,<br />
The whole house stirs again, the feast is past,<br />
And sadly passes by the afternoon ...<br />
<br />
Like resurrection were the garments white<br />
The wreathed procession walked through trees arched wide<br />
Into the church, as cool as silk inside,<br />
With long aisles of tall candles flaming bright:<br />
The lights all shone like jewels rich and rare<br />
To solemn eyes that watched them gleam and flare.<br />
<br />
Then through the silence the great song rose high<br />
Up to the vaulted dome like clouds it soared,<br />
Then luminously, gently down it poured&mdash;<br />
Over white veils like rain it seemed to die.<br />
<br />
The wind through the white garments softly stirred<br />
And they grew vari-coloured in each fold<br />
And each fold hidden blossoms seemed to hold<br />
And flowers and stars and fluting notes of bird,<br />
And dim, quaint figures shimmering like gold<br />
Seemed to come forth from distant myths of old.<br />
<br />
Outside the day was one of green and blue,<br />
With touches of a luminous glowing red,<br />
Across the quiet pond the small waves sped.<br />
Beyond the city, gardens hidden from view<br />
Sent odors of sweet blossoms on the breeze<br />
And singing sounded through the far off trees.<br />
<br />
It was as though garlands crowned everything<br />
And all things were touched softly by the sun;<br />
And many windows opened one by one<br />
And the light trembled on them glistening.<br />

Ah yes! I long for you. To you I glide<br />
And lose myself&mdash;for to you I belong.<br />
The hope that hitherto I have denied<br />
Imperious comes to me as from your side<br />
Serious, unfaltering and swift and strong.<br />
<br />
Those times: the times when I was quite alone<br />
By memories wrapt that whispered to me low,<br />
My silence was the quiet of a stone<br />
Over which rippling murmuring waters flow.<br />
<br />
But in these weeks of the awakening Spring<br />
Something within me has been freed&mdash;something<br />
That in the past dark years unconscious lay,<br />
Which rises now within me and commands<br />
And gives my poor warm life into your hands<br />
Who know not what I was that Yesterday.<br />

Upon the bridge the blind man stands alone,<br />
Gray like a mist veiled monument he towers<br />
As though of nameless realms the boundary stone<br />
About which circle distant starry hours.<br />
<br />
He seems the center around which stars glow<br />
While all earth's ostentations surge below.<br />
<br />
Immovably and silently he stands<br />
Placed where the confused current ebbs and flows;<br />
Past fathomless dark depths that he commands<br />
A shallow generation drifting goes....<br />

I am a Queen, I am a Queen!<br />
To your knee, to your knee!<br />

Who were you then, Marie?<br />
Know you that I was no man's child,<br />
Poor and in rags&mdash;said she.<br />

And then a Princess I became<br />
To whom men bend their knees;<br />
To princes things are not the same<br />
As those a beggar sees.<br />
<br />
And those things which have made you great<br />
Came to you, tell me, when?<br />
One night, one night, one night quite late,<br />
Things became different then.<br />
<br />
I walked the lane which presently<br />
With strung chords seemed to bend;<br />
Then Marie became Melody<br />
And danced from end to end.<br />
<br />
The people watched with startled mien<br />
And passed with frightened glance<br />
For all know that only a Queen<br />
May dance in the lanes: dance!...<br />

Oh! All things are long passed away and far.<br />
A light is shining but the distant star<br />
From which it still comes to me has been dead<br />
A thousand years ... In the dim phantom boat<br />
That glided past some ghastly thing was said.<br />
A clock just struck within some house remote.<br />
Which house?&mdash;I long to still my beating heart.<br />
Beneath the sky's vast dome I long to pray ...<br />
Of all the stars there must be far away<br />
A single star which still exists apart.<br />
And I believe that I should know the one<br />
Which has alone endured and which alone<br />
Like a white City that all space commands<br />
At the ray's end in the high heaven stands.<br />

Our joyous force leaps like these dancing tears.<br />

As when at times there breaks through branches bare<br />
A morning vibrant with the breath of spring,<br />
About this poet-head a splendour rare<br />
Transforms it almost to a mortal thing.<br />
<br />
There is as yet no shadow in his glance,<br />
Too cool his temples for the laurel's glow;<br />
But later o'er those marble brows, perchance,<br />
A rose-garden with bushes tall will grow,<br />
<br />
And single petals one by one will fall<br />
O'er the still mouth and break its silent thrall,<br />
&mdash;The mouth that trembles with a dawning smile<br />
As though a song were rising there the while.<br />

We still remember! The same as of yore<br />
All that has happened once again must be.<br />
As grows a lemon-tree upon the shore&mdash;<br />
It was like that&mdash;your light, small breasts you bore,<br />
And his blood's current coursed like the wild sea.<br />
<br />
That god&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 7em;">who was the wanderer, the slim</span><br />
Despoiler of fair women; he&mdash;the wise,&mdash;<br />

While bending like your arched brows o'er your eyes.<br />

You Hour! From me you ever take your flight,<br />
Your swift wings wound me as they whir along;<br />
Without you void would be my day and night,<br />
Without you I'll not capture my great song.<br />
<br />
I have no earthly spot where I can live,<br />
I have no love, I have no household fane,<br />
And all the things to which myself I give<br />
Impoverish me with richness they attain.<br />

His weary glance, from passing by the bars,<br />
Has grown into a dazed and vacant stare;<br />
It seems to him there are a thousand bars<br />
And out beyond those bars the empty air.<br />
<br />
The pad of his strong feet, that ceaseless sound<br />
Of supple tread behind the iron bands,<br />
Is like a dance of strength circling around,<br />
While in the circle, stunned, a great will stands.<br />
<br />
But there are times the pupils of his eyes<br />
Dilate, the strong limbs stand alert, apart,<br />
Tense with the flood of visions that arise<br />
Only to sink and die within his heart.<br />

Among all the others there sat a guest<br />
Who sipped her tea as if one apart,<br />
And she held her cup not quite like the rest;<br />
Once she smiled so it pierced one's heart.<br />
<br />
When the group of people arose at last<br />
And laughed and talked in a merry tone,<br />
As lingeringly through the rooms they passed<br />
I saw that she followed alone.<br />
<br />
Tense and still like one who to sing must rise<br />
Before a throng on a festal night<br />
She lifted her head, and her bright glad eyes<br />
Were like pools which reflected light.<br />
<br />
She followed on slowly after the last<br />
As though some object must be passed by,<br />
And yet as if were it once but passed<br />
She would no longer walk but fly.<br />

As a lit match first flickers in the hands<br />
Before it flames, and darts out from all sides<br />
Bright, twitching tongues, so, ringed by growing bands<br />
Of spectators&mdash;she, quivering, glowing stands<br />
Poised tensely for the dance&mdash;then forward glides<br />
<br />
And suddenly becomes a flaming torch.<br />
Her bright hair flames, her burning glances scorch,<br />
And with a daring art at her command<br />
Her whole robe blazes like a fire-brand<br />
From which is stretched each naked arm, awake,<br />
Gleaming and rattling like a frightened snake.<br />
<br />
And then, as though the fire fainter grows,<br />
She gathers up the flame&mdash;again it glows,<br />
As with proud gesture and imperious air<br />
She flings it to the earth; and it lies there<br />
Furiously flickering and crackling still&mdash;<br />
Then haughtily victorious, but with sweet<br />
Swift smile of greeting, she puts forth her will<br />
And stamps the flames out with her small firm feet.<br />

My body glows in every vein and blooms<br />
To fullest flower since I first knew thee,<br />
My walk unconscious pride and power assumes;<br />
Who art thou then&mdash;thou who awaitest me?<br />
<br />
When from the past I draw myself the while<br />
I lose old traits as leaves of autumn fall;<br />
I only know the radiance of thy smile,<br />
Like the soft gleam of stars, transforming all.<br />
<br />
Through childhood's years I wandered unaware<br />
Of shimmering visions my thoughts now arrests<br />
To offer thee, as on an altar fair<br />
That's lighted by the bright flame of thy hair<br />
And wreathéd by the blossoms of thy breasts.<br />

When my soul touches yours a great chord sings!<br />
How shall I tune it then to other things?<br />
O! That some spot in darkness could be found<br />
That does not vibrate whene'er your depths sound.<br />
But everything that touches you and me<br />
Welds us as played strings sound one melody.<br />
Where is the instrument whence the sounds flow?<br />
And whose the master-hand that holds the bow?<br />
O! Sweet song&mdash;<br />

We cannot fathom his mysterious head,<br />
Through the veiled eyes no flickering ray is sent:<br />
But from his torso gleaming light is shed<br />
As from a candelabrum; inward bent<br />
His glance there glows and lingers. Otherwise<br />
The round breast would not blind you with its grace,<br />
Nor could the soft-curved circle of the thighs<br />
Steal to the arc whence issues a new race.<br />
Nor could this stark and stunted stone display<br />
Vibrance beneath the shoulders heavy bar,<br />
Nor shine like fur upon a beast of prey,<br />
Nor break forth from its lines like a great star&mdash;<br />
There is no spot that does not bind you fast<br />
And transport you back, back to a far past.<br />

The beat of my wings hums,<br />

Who drew his radiant colours from the sun.<br />
Mysteriously glowing through a background dim<br />
When he was suffering she came to him,<br />
And all the heavy pain within his heart<br />
Rose in his hands and stole into his art.<br />
His canvas is the beautiful bright veil<br />
Through which her sorrow shines. There where the<br />

<br />
But though my vigil constantly I keep<br />
My God is dark&mdash;like woven texture flowing,<br />
A hundred drinking roots, all intertwined;<br />
I only know that from His warmth I'm growing.<br />
More I know not: my roots lie hidden deep<br />
My branches only are swayed by the wind.<br />

When thou art dreaming then I am thy Dream,<br />

Myself unto the past:&mdash;again I live.<br />

Out of my dark hours wisdom dawns apace,<br />
Infinite Life unrolls its boundless space ...<br />

Shakes a ripe tree that grows above a grave<br />

Dreams that were closely cherished and for long,<br />
Are lost once more in sadness and in song.<br />

Who still sat at table and drank from the glass<br />

Few follow it, the way is long and steep.<br />
You dwell in solitude&mdash;Oh, does your glowing<br />
Heart in some far off valley lie asleep?<br />

My bloody hands, with digging bruised, I've lifted,<br />
Spread like a tree I stretch them in the air<br />

I reach out into space to seek you there ...<br />

Flashing from distant stars on sweeping wing,<br />
You come, and over earth a magic vesture<br />
Steals gently as the rain falls in the spring.<br />

And where at dusk in caverns hollow<br />
They croon to music of the night.<br />
Send me far into Thy barren land<br />
Where the snow clouds the wild wind drives,<br />
Where monasteries like gray shrouds stand&mdash;<br />
August symbols of unlived lives.<br />
There pilgrims climb slowly one by one,<br />
And behind them a blind man goes:<br />
With him I will walk till day is done<br />
Up the pathway that no one knows ...<br />

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
